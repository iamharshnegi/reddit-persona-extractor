      "text": "Dear r/RelationshipIndia  Community,\n\nWe are committed to maintaining a respectful, engaging, and supportive environment for every member of our Subreddit. Our goal has always been to foster a space where individuals can seek advice, share experiences, and offer support without fear of judgment or harassment.\n\nHowever, it has come to our attention that despite our efforts, instances of unacceptable behaviour such as slut-shaming, bigotry, and sexism have been on the rise. This is not the community we aspire to be. We have been lenient in the hope that our community members would self-moderate, but unfortunately, things have not improved.\n\nTherefore, we are implementing a zero-tolerance policy effective immediately. Any form of shaming, derogatory comments, or bigotry will result in an immediate and permanent ban. We are taking this stance not to punish, but to protect the integrity and safety of our community.\n\nWe understand that this is a significant change, and some may find this approach strict. However, let us be clear: our Subreddit is a safe space for everyone, and any behaviour that undermines this will not be tolerated.\n\nWe are also increasing our moderation efforts to monitor the Subreddit more heavily. Our mod team will be vigilant, and we encourage our community to use the report function to alert us of any rule-breaking content.\n\nWe believe these changes are necessary to ensure that Subreddit remains a place where all individuals can seek and offer support in a safe and welcoming environment.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Mod Team",
