      "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI bought my 3a 2 months ago. Everything was working fine but after the recent update(47mb update) my 3a's display flickers randomly. \n\nAt first, it only happened when I was typing something using Google keyboard. I thought it might be a bug that is related to G-board. So I went to playstore and updated G-board to the latest version but it didn't helped me. I also tried rebooting my phone several times but it didn't work either. \n\nBut today, it flickered randomly. I was not even typing anything and it flickered few times today. It happens soo randomly, I couldn't even record a video.\n\nBy flickering, I mean - it suddenly goes to high brightness and returns to normal within a seconds.\n\nIDK what to do. Any solutions for this? \n",

People are started to use Al for content and getting views and likes easily with just a prompt. This reel had 10k likes. If this is got normalised then everything we see will be made by Al.\n\nI wanna make it clear that I'm not against using Al. Using it for thumbnail(which is also not good imo), reasearch and some for quick info is good. But using it for the whole content is not something we should normalise imo.\n\nWhats your take on this guys?",
